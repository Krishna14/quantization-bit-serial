# quantization-bit-serial
Code to implement functionality of the intended architecture

# Features currently supported
1. Implementation completed using Google Colab Pro's infrastructure.
2. Layer wise quantization using the BitSerial infrastructure.
3. Verification has been completed using the inference of golden outputs.
4. Plots are obtained for each of the layers and their percentages of zero in the ReLU infrastructure.
